Stressed soft materials commonly present viscoelastic signatures in the form of power-law or exponential decay. Although exponential responses are the most common, power-law time dependencies arise peculiarly in complex soft materials such as living cells. Understanding the microscale mechanisms that drive rheologic behaviors at the macroscale shall be transformative in fields such as material design and bioengineering. Using an elastic network model of macromolecules
immersed in a viscous fluid, we numerically reproduce those
characteristic viscoelastic relaxations and show how the microscopic
interactions determine the rheologic response. The macromolecules,
represented by particles in the network, interact with
neighbors through a spring constant $k$ and with fluid through a
non-linear drag regime. The dissipative force is given by $\gamma
v^{\alpha}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity, and $\gamma$ and
$\alpha$ are mesoscopic parameters. Physically, the sublinear regime
of the drag forces is related to micro-deformations of the
macromolecules, while $\alpha\geq 1$ represents rigid cases. We obtain
exponential or power-law relaxations or a transitional behavior between
them by changing $k$, $\gamma$, and $\alpha$. We find that exponential
decays are indeed the most common behavior. However, power laws
may arise when forces between the macromolecules and the fluid are
sublinear. Our findings show that in materials not too soft not too
elastic, the rheological responses are entirely controlled by $\alpha$
in the sublinear regime. More specifically, power-law responses arise
for $0.3\lessapprox \alpha \lessapprox 0.45$, while exponential
responses for small and large values of $\alpha$, namely,
$0.0\lessapprox \alpha \lessapprox 0.2$ and $0.55\lessapprox \alpha
\lessapprox 1.0$.
